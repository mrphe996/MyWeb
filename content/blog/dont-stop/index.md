description: Pink is my favourite colour. I used to say my favourite colour was black to be cool, but it is pink - all shades of pink. If I have an accessory, it is probably pink.

### Picasso had his pink period and his blue period. I am in my blonde period right now.

When I first started wearing pink, it wasn't nothing I planned on doing or strategized. But people showed me so much love for the pink mink I wore, I had to go out to Pantone and create my own color, which is called Killa Pink.

So affection is inherently emotion. It's like a bolt of lightning, coming on tight and going fast. It came suddenly and the fact that it won't tell you exactly at what time? So cherish those who are loving on your side, so that the rays will remain here forever.
