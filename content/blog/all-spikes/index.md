If you don’t know where you are going, you will probably end up somewhere else.  – Lawrence J. Peter
Before you can develop persistence and eventually achieve success, you need to first identify your wants or desires. You can do this by simply writing down specifically all the things you want to have or accomplish. List down all your desires and wants, no matter how impossible they are to achieve in the moment.


All your goal-setting and planning will go to waste if you won’t be able to develop discipline and good habit.
Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment. – Jim Rohn
There will be a lot of hindrances that will stop you from moving towards your goal, and without proper discipline, it will be easy for you to sail away. Upholding discipline and good habits can help you stay in the course, even despite difficulties.
